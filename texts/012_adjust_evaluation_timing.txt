Title: Adjust Excavator Evaluation Interval and Operation Timing for Realistic Behavior
Date: 2025-12-07

Summary
- Adjusted evaluation interval from 0.5 seconds to 2.0 seconds to match realistic excavator operation cycles
- Extended digging cycle timing from 7 seconds total to 15 seconds total to reflect actual machine behavior
- Added documentation about force/torque control parameters for ML training considerations
- Changes applied across all test files (test1.agxPy, test2.agxPy, test3.agxPy)

Background / Problem Statement
The user identified that the current simulation was evaluating excavator performance every 2 seconds (referring to the operation intervals in the digging cycle), which is too fast compared to real excavator operations. This could lead to:
1. ML agents learning to apply excessive torque to meet unrealistic timing constraints
2. Simulation behavior that doesn't match real-world excavator operation patterns
3. Training results that wouldn't transfer well to actual excavator control

Changes Made

1. Score Evaluation Interval (SCORE_CONFIG.check_interval)
   - Before: 0.5 seconds between mass evaluations
   - After: 2.0 seconds between mass evaluations
   - Rationale: Matches more realistic inspection/evaluation cycles for excavator operations
   - Files: test1.agxPy, test3.agxPy

2. Digging Cycle Timing (digCycle function)
   Extended all operation timings to reflect realistic excavator movement speeds:
   - Arm down: 2s → 4s
   - Stick extend: 2s → 5s  
   - Bucket close: 3s → 7s
   - Arm lift: 6s → 12s
   - Bucket open: 7s → 14s
   - Arm extend: 7s → 15s
   
   Total cycle duration: 7 seconds → 15 seconds
   Files: test1.agxPy, test2.agxPy, test3.agxPy

3. HUD Update Interval
   - Before: 0.25 seconds
   - After: 0.5 seconds
   - Rationale: Reduced update frequency matches the slower operation cycle
   - Files: test3.agxPy

4. Documentation Added
   Added explanatory comments near LOCK_FORCE_RANGE definition:
   "Force/Torque control parameters
    Note: These values should reflect realistic excavator hydraulic capabilities.
    For ML training, ensure evaluation intervals and movement timing allow the agent
    to learn realistic torque patterns rather than requiring excessive force to meet
    unrealistic timing constraints."
   Files: test1.agxPy, test3.agxPy

Benefits of These Changes

1. Realistic Torque Learning
   - ML agents will learn torque patterns that match actual excavator capabilities
   - Reduced risk of training agents that rely on excessive force

2. Better Simulation Fidelity
   - Operation timing matches real excavator movement speeds
   - More realistic for testing and validation

3. Improved Training Outcomes
   - Learned behaviors should transfer better to real excavators
   - Agents won't be penalized for operating within realistic physical constraints

How to Validate

1. Run any of the test files:
   agxviewer test3.agxPy

2. Observe the digging cycle:
   - Press 'E' to start automatic digging
   - Movement should appear more deliberate and realistic
   - Full cycle should take approximately 15 seconds instead of 7

3. Check score updates:
   - Score should update every 2 seconds instead of 0.5 seconds
   - HUD should refresh every 0.5 seconds

4. For ML training:
   - Train agents with the new timing parameters
   - Compare learned torque profiles with the previous version
   - Verify that torque requirements are within realistic bounds (±1.0e6 range)

Future Considerations

1. Fine-tuning may be needed based on:
   - Specific excavator model being simulated
   - Soil/material properties
   - Task requirements (speed vs precision tradeoffs)

2. Consider making timing parameters configurable via UI or config file for easier experimentation

3. May want to add telemetry to track actual torque usage during operations to ensure it stays within realistic ranges

4. For different excavator sizes or types, timing parameters may need adjustment

Notes
- These changes maintain backward compatibility with existing simulation features
- No changes to physics parameters or contact materials
- Keyboard controls and UI remain unchanged
- The evaluation logic itself is unchanged, only the timing intervals
